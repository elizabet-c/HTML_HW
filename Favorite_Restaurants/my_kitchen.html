        <h1>A kitchen full of chaos and learning</h1>
        <p>I have grown up cooking with my mom. She cooks at an extremely fast pace so I needed to make sure I was ready to go handing her whatever
            utensil or plate she needed. Since then, I have always cooked at a much slower pace. This often leads to a dinner with food at different 
            temperatures. It has definitely been a learning experience, and the stove still intimidates me. But I have learned how to bake tofu pretty
            well if I do say so myself.
